# Call Centre Data Transmission and Communication

This project briefly explains the concept of OSPF(Open Shortest Path First) protocol and shows its
implementation with a use case scenario. Here the scenario is
communication and transmission of data, within the branches of a call
center.

It also illustrates OSPF protocolâ€™s benefits and possible (if any) issues.
The OSPF Protocol is a dynamic routing protocol which provides a highly
functional open protocol that any vendor can use to communicate using the
TCP/IP protocol family. It can converge the networks extremely fast and
ensures loop free paths.

It has features that allow for the stricter propagation of routes, for load
sharing, and for selective route importing. It can also provide better load
sharing on external links rather than other IGPs (Internal Gateway
Protocols).

OSPF Protocol is a famous TCP/IP Internal
Gateway Protocol which is used to distribute information within a single
system. It is based on link-state technology which is different from
algorithms like RIPv4 which are used in Internet Routing protocols.
